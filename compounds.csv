"Guys, number 5 is KEY. You gotta surround yourself with success minded people. I am 32. Even though I knew this before, I didn‚Äôt take it to heart. Seriously, stop tolerating toxic and negative people, and make it a priority to connect with people who aspire to become the best version of themselves. If I could give some advice to my younger self, this would be it. John, great video. You got a lot of talent. Keep uploading and helping. You got a great purpose my friend. ü§ü",0.9584

"Your ""school doesn't matter"" advice is helping me a lot. I mean, I've realized that you are right. I've been caring so much about school for last year, but in the end I'm not improving as much as I am tryharding... The differece between my last year grades and this year doesn't represent the extra effort that I'm doing. And I think this is because I was happier last year because I did my hobbies much more often than this one. Thank you Jhon :)
